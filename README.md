# Translate the research question into a Common Data Model.

To do this, we are going to use the Common Data Model Builder (cdmb) library.
The Common Data Model Builder (cdmb) is a Python library that facilitates the construction of data models for projects with a defined structure.

Link to the Python library:

https://github.com/cienciadedatosysalud/cdmb

Link to the tutorial (EUPHA):

https://github.com/cienciadedatosysalud/tutorial_cdmb_EUPHA

Configuration file for by-covid_baseline-use-case_EUPHA (cdmb_config.json)

[docs/CDM/cdmb_config.json](https://github.com/cienciadedatosysalud/by-covid_baseline-use-case_EUPHA/blob/main/docs/CDM/cdmb_config.json)

It's time to start the [tutorial](https://github.com/cienciadedatosysalud/tutorial_cdmb_EUPHA)! ðŸ¦¾

# Technical part (ðŸ’»)

If you have reached this point you have successfully completed the tutorial, **congratulations!**

Let's review what you get when using the Common Data Model Builder library.

- A fixed and standardized folder structure in which to develop the analysis scripts. A structure where all the information entered by a domain expert is collected and expressed in a way that a computer scientist can easily interpret
- Project information
- Cohort information
- Information of all defined entities:
  - Syntactic and semantic information of all variables of each entity.
  - Catalogues used to define the entity.
  - Validation rules.
  - Synthetic data 
- Data Quality Assessment script
- Rule validation report script
- Header and syntax checking script for csv input files

# Distribution (ðŸŒŽ)
Once the analyses have been developed.

How is your project distributed? 

One of the alternatives is to containerize your application (e.g., Docker, Singularity). 

To learn more, visit the [ASPIRE (Analytic Software Pipeline Interface for Reproducible Execution)](https://github.com/cienciadedatosysalud/aspire) repository. 

(APIRE has been used for the distribution of this Use Case.)

## HOW TO RUN IN DOCKER
Use the following code snippet to create the container.
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cienciadedatosysalud/bycovid-eupha:latest

docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 --name bycovid-eupha-aspire ghcr.io/cienciadedatosysalud/bycovid-eupha:latest

# Open your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
```

## HOW TO RUN IN SINGULARITY
Use the following code snippet to create the container.
```bash
singularity build bycovid-eupha.sif docker://ghcr.io/cienciadedatosysalud/bycovid-eupha:latest

singularity run -f -w bycovid-eupha.sif

# Open your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
```
